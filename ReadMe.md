ObservatoryDM Project
===================

This project uses [VO-DML tools](https://ivoa.github.io/vo-dml/) to define a data model.

The source for the model is in [model/ObservatoryDM-v1.vodsl](model/ObservatoryDM-v1.vodsl)

```
gradle test
```
should build the model and run tests against it.
```shell
gradle testSite
```
should build the site and make it available at http://localhost:8000
